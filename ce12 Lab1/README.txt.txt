-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
At first I learned how to use Multimedia logic connect circuit by using AND gate, 
Or gate and NOT gate that can output what we want. Also, I learned how to use SOP
and POS logic to build a circuit. The connection of AND gate, OR gate and NOT gate
implementate to NAND gate and NOR gate.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
PartA and PartC(c_0) worked well because both problem just need a little bit of thoughful.
However, PartB, PartC(c_1) and PartC(c_2) need more thought and very well understanding 
about implementation logic, but also worked well finally with couple hours to think the logic.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
If I could redesign this Lab, I would make some easy problem that could help students understand
how to use the Multimedia Logic first, and go more deeply after the well understanding. And I would
design the part of this Lab is build the input switched without providing, let the student fell free to 
make their circuit.

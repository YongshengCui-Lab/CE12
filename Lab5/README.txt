-------------------------
What was your design approach?
I create a loop that if the user put in something that match, it will go to next step, which is kind of the key to go next step. When the user put the correct key, then it will go to encrypted or decrypted and resulting string as well as the user input key. Then display to user.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
Yup. I am kind of confuse how to make a string as a key to encrypted or decrypted. And also Caesar Cipher is the thing I never hear before, I spend some times to understand how it work which would shift the string letter.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would recommand to create a new key that provide to student to show how it work if they put the key correctly, and show them if the key don't correct, it will go to aonther place which like warning system.
Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated with and the nature of your collaboration.
I finished the Lab by myself.

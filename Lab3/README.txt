-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these stringsare stored?
The text of my prompts are stored in the processor’s memory in the MIPS architecture, memory addresses range from 0 to 4,294,967,295.
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Ilearned how to use mips to create a loop in order to write a program other than using java or C++. It's new language but more control of the program. And also I learn ASCII that using number to represent char and number and command like li
or la to print the character or string. And also learned how to exit the program by using a line of code. 
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you foundenjoyable?
Yeap. I encounter how to output the triangle by relate the symbol. It's good to write a program in new language. The triangle is not repeat which only show 1 triangle no matter how user input the number.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would make another rectangular for extra credit in order to feel faimilar with the new language. 
Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaboratedwith and the nature of your collaboration.
I coolborate with Demon which talk about how to relate everything to build a triangle without coding.

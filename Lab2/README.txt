What were the learning objectives of this lab?
I spend a lot of times in this lab because it need to connect everything perfectly
in order to complete the game. I learned how to due with flip flop(register) in mml
and how flip flop work for pre-set, clear, data and clock. The adder file is required
more logic that connect whack check / score adjustment and 4-bit register in order to 
add or subtract the value. Therefore, this lab is challenge and required more time to 
figure out how each part work and how to connect them, but it's cool lab to everyone 
who walk step by step until the game work.

What was your design approach?
I spend a lot of time to figure out how to play this game, and how each part like Register
Adder work into the game. Then I created 4-bit register first and connect it to adder with 
some logic that could satisfy the need. Then I created 2's complement conversion and build
whack check / score mole logic without using whack receiver.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
yup. I encounter the register doesn't show up the digit while I click whack button and
negative sign doesn't work as well. Created register is enjoyable and the sign that  if 
sgn3 output 1, the sign will show negative that surprise me.

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
Since this lab is kind of difficult to do, I would remove the sign segement because
it kind of new to me.
